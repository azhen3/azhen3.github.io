<!--                        <p>As a child, I was always fascinated by the Chinese myths and legends my parents used to tell me. I realized as I got older that most of those stories captured moral lessons found in Confucianism, a philosophy my family follows. Within Confucianism, there is a practice called ancestor worship, a ritual in which the family honors its ancestors.</p>-->
                        <p>Ancestor worship is an ancient tradition, which is still practiced today by my family. I was inspired by the rich culture behind these rituals, and wished to understand its significance in modern society. To embrace this experience, I wanted to create a piece of furniture which embodied the traditional aspects of ancestor worship, but also reflected the modernized ritual from a Chinese American. </p>

                        Ancestor worship brings the family together; thus, I wanted to create a piece that did exactly that. My initial concepts drew upon personal experiences of gathering in the dining room to pray in front of the shrine on the mantel. I drew elements from Chinese history, inspired by the proportional form, intricate carvings, and the fusion of organic and geometric shapes. I wished to simplify the elements of Chinese ornamentation by developing my own meaning, one originating from my background as a Chinese American.

                        I explored form, incorporating the paper money leaflets that are commonly burned during ancestor worship to symbolize sending gifts. I visited a local oriental furniture store, and was inspired by the traditional and contemporary pieces displayed. I sketched ideas ranging from urns formed from geometrical symbols, to tables integrating linearity with the organic aspect of the paper money.

                       After many iterations, I chose to focus on shrine furniture, for it was the unifying piece between family and ancestors. The shrine integrated geometric elements (inspired by Han dynasty art), traditional Chinese furniture designs, and the paper money leaflets.

                        I was fascinated by the temple gates when I visited China, and I wished to bring that aspect into my design by creating the temple-like front fa√ßade. The leaflets are incorporated along the sides of the piece, weaving seamlessly from the top base to the bottom body. The top base bevel and the angled legs allow the eyes to follow the piece continuously. The proportion of the body to leg ratio is approximately 1:1, which reflects the symmetry often found in Chinese furniture.

                        <p>Building this piece required significant amount of preparation. I first had to find the right wood to use. Rosewood is commonly used in Chinese furniture; however, it is very rare and expensive. I saw this as an opportunity to explore other options, perhaps to use contemporary woods to signify the integration of Western and Eastern elements. I chose mahogany with black cherry stain, which mimicked the dark and rich color seen in Chinese furniture and brought out the beautiful grain of the wood.</p>
                        <p>Another issue was the design of the cabinet doors. From the rendering, the sides follow the 5 degree angle from the legs. However, this is not feasible if the doors are swinging outward. I decided that creating a separate piece within the space would allow the cabinets to swing freely at 90 degrees.</p>

                        One of the difficult portions of this project was to cut and prepare the wood to built together. I propped up a sheet of wood against another to create a 5 degree angle for the bevel, and ran the piece through the table saw. After cutting all the pieces, I secured the sides and legs using a staple gun through small blocks of wood for strength and stability. The hinges had to be screwed into a longer piece of wood, but is blends with the side walls when the top piece is added. Each leaflet was made from roof flashing, which was hand-cut and spray painted with a bronze finish. I then hammered each individually to produce a shingle pattern.

The front view resembles the foundations of Chinese culture, inspired by the temple-gate form and large cabinet doors. However, as an observer walks around the piece, he will see the leaflets, a subtle accent that brings life to the modern form.
